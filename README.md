##Isochronic Map

What is your mental map of a city? I bet itâ€™s not measured in miles. This project was part of my thesis work at MIT SENSEable City Lab. In an isochronic map, the distance between a given spot and any other places of the city is not proportional to their geographical distance, but the cost taken to get there.

Here is [my blog post](http://xiaoji-chen.com/blog/2010/map-of-paris-visualizing-urban-transportation/) on the isochronic maps of Paris:

I talked more about the process in my thesis [Seeing Differently: Cartography for Subjective Maps Based on Dynamic Urban Data](http://descomp.scripts.mit.edu/www/_main_dir_link/images_projects/takehiko_01/xiaoji_map/xiaoji_map.html)

##The Code

The primary purpose of this code was to produce static images and videos. The code is far from well maintained in terms of annotation and architecture. I was and still am in the transition from a designer to an a-little-bit-more-serious programmer.  

It has been a while since I last touched this code. I tried clean it up a bit and removed some sensitive data. Any feedback would be appreciated.

Compiling with Processing 2.0b5 succeeded.
